# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This is an ongoing project that showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a developer. Feel free to explore the different sections to get a better understanding of my work.

The portfolio website is being built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<ul>
  <li>HTML: Provides the structure and content of the website.</li>
  <li>CSS: Handles the visual styling and layout.</li>
  <li>JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the website.</li>
</ul>

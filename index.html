                <p>A computer is a programmable electronic device that processes data and performs various tasks based on instructions given to it. It consists of hardware components, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input/output devices, and software that allows it to operate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="b-block">
                <p>At its core, a computer uses binary code, which is a system of representing data and instructions using only two digits: 0 and 1. These digits are called bits, and they form the building blocks of all digital information. The computer's hardware components work together to manipulate and interpret these binary signals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="b-block">
                <p>The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and carries out the necessary operations. The memory, also known as RAM (Random Access Memory), stores data and instructions temporarily while the computer is running. Storage devices, such as hard drives or solid-state drives, provide long-term storage for data and programs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="b-block">
                <p>Input devices allow users to provide information to the computer, such as keyboards, mice, and touchscreens. Output devices display or transmit processed information to the user, such as monitors, printers, and speakers. These devices facilitate communication between humans and computers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="b-block">
                <p>Software refers to the programs and data that tell the computer what to do. Operating systems, like Windows, macOS, or Linux, manage the computer's resources and provide a user interface. Applications or software programs, such as word processors, web browsers, and video games, are designed to perform specific tasks and run on top of the operating system.</p>
